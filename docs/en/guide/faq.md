# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are answers to common questions users may encounter while using NewbeePaste.

## Basic Usage

### How to Launch NewbeePaste?

After installation, NewbeePaste runs automatically in the system tray (Windows) or menu bar (macOS). You can open the main interface by:

- **Windows**: Press `Alt + V` shortcut (default)
- **macOS**: Press `Option + V` shortcut (default, adjustable in system settings)
- Or **click the system tray/menu bar icon**

### Why isn't my copied content appearing in the clipboard history?

Possible reasons include:

- NewbeePaste is not running, or clipboard monitoring is disabled.
- The copied content is filtered by "Ignore Rules" or "Privacy Mode."
- Insufficient app permissions to monitor clipboard changes (especially on macOS, where Accessibility permissions are required).
- The copied content is too large or in an unsupported format.

### Why isn't my copied content syncing across devices?

Content may fail to sync due to:

- **Network issues**: Check if your device has a stable internet connection.
- **Account not logged in**: Ensure all devices are logged into the same NewbeePaste account.
- **Sync toggle disabled**: Verify that the sync toggle is enabled in settings for the respective device.
- **Content size exceeds limits**: Check if the file or image size exceeds the configured or membership-level limit.
- **Keyword filtering**: Ensure no keyword filtering rules are blocking the content.
- **Server issues**: Rarely, temporary server outages may cause sync failures.

### How to manage synced devices?

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Switch to the **"Device Management"** tab.
3. View all devices linked to your account and their online status.
4. Rename devices or click the button next to a device (e.g., "Unlink") to disconnect it from your account.

## Features

### How to pin frequently used clipboard items?

1. Open the NewbeePaste main interface and locate the item you want to pin.
2. Hover over the item.
3. Click the **pin icon** or "Favorite" button that appears.
4. Pinned items will appear in the "Favorites" category and may be displayed at the top of the main list (depending on your settings).

### Why can't some images sync or preview?

- **Size limit**: The image file size may exceed the configured sync limit.
- **Unsupported format**: While common formats (PNG, JPG, etc.) are supported, some uncommon or corrupted formats may not be processed.
- **Network issues**: Syncing large images requires a stable network connection and sufficient bandwidth.
- **Storage space**: Insufficient cloud storage space may prevent syncing.

## Performance Optimization

### What to do if the app feels slow or uses too much memory?

1. **Adjust history retention**: Reduce the "History Retention Count" or shorten the "History Retention Period" (e.g., from "Forever" to "30 days") in settings.
2. **Clear history**: Manually or periodically delete unnecessary clipboard history, especially large images or files.
3. **Disable unused features**: Turn off advanced features (e.g., OCR, translation) if not needed.
4. **Update the app**: Ensure you're using the latest version of NewbeePaste, as updates may include performance optimizations.
5. **Restart the app/device**: A simple restart can resolve temporary performance issues.

### How to improve cross-device sync speed?

- **Ensure a stable network**: Use a reliable and fast Wi-Fi or wired connection.
- **Optimize sync content**:
  - Adjust the file/image size limit in settings to avoid syncing overly large content.
  - Exclude certain content types (e.g., files) from syncing.
- **Choose a closer server**: If the app allows, select a sync server closer to your location.
- **Avoid peak hours**: Sync during off-peak times to reduce network congestion.
- **Close bandwidth-heavy apps**: Pause downloads, streaming, or other bandwidth-intensive activities.

## Other Questions

### Which operating systems are supported?

Currently supported:

- **Windows**: Windows 10 and above
- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 and above

Check the official website for the latest compatibility updates.

### How is clipboard data security ensured?

NewbeePaste prioritizes user data security:

- **Encrypted transmission**: All account and sync data are encrypted during transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS).
- **Local encryption**: Sensitive data stored locally (e.g., history database) is encrypted.
- **Privacy settings**: Features like keyword filtering and ignore rules protect your privacy.
- **Cloud security**: Cloud-stored data is protected with robust security measures.
- **Remote logout**: You can remotely log out from other devices via device management.

### How to back up NewbeePaste data?

NewbeePaste relies on cloud sync for data backup:

- Once logged in, your clipboard history (text, images, etc.) is automatically encrypted and stored in the cloud.
- Logging into the same account on a new device will restore your data from the cloud.
- No manual backup is requiredâ€”just ensure your account is logged in and connected to the internet.
