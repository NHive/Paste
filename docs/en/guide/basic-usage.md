# Basic Usage Guide for NewbeePaste

Welcome to NewbeePaste! This guide will help you quickly master the core features of NewbeePaste, improving your daily copy-paste efficiency.

## Open the Main Interface

You can quickly access the NewbeePaste main interface in the following ways:

1.  **Global Shortcut (Default):**
    - Windows: Press `Alt + V`
    - macOS: Press `Option + V` (the `Option` key is equivalent to `Alt` on Windows)
    - _You can customize this shortcut in the settings._
2.  **System Tray Icon:**
    - Locate the NewbeePaste icon in the system tray area at the corner of your screen.
    - Click the icon to open the main interface.

## Copy Content

NewbeePaste runs silently in the background and automatically monitors your clipboard activity.

- When you use the standard copy operation (e.g., `Ctrl+C` or `Command+C`) in any application to copy **text, images, or files**, NewbeePaste automatically captures the content and adds it to the top of the clipboard history list.

## View and Filter Clipboard History

After opening the main interface, you will see the clipboard history sorted in reverse chronological order.

- **Scroll to Browse:** Use your mouse wheel or touchpad to scroll through the history. Thanks to virtual scrolling technology, browsing remains smooth even with a large number of records.
- **Category Filters:** The main interface typically provides category tabs (e.g., **Common / Text / Images / Files / Favorites**). Click on a tab to quickly filter the corresponding type of content.
- **Quick Preview:** Hover over an image or file entry to display preview information.

## Paste Content

Pasting content from NewbeePaste's history into your current application (e.g., editor, chat window) is simple:

1.  **Double-click an Entry:** This is the fastest way. Double-click any entry in the list, and its content will automatically paste at your current cursor position.
2.  **Select and Press Enter:** Use the keyboard arrow keys or click to select an entry, then press `Enter` to paste it.
3.  **Right-click Menu:** Right-click on an entry and select the "Paste" option from the menu.

## Search Clipboard History

If you have a large history, use the search function to quickly locate specific entries:

- The main interface usually includes a **search box**.
- Enter keywords in the search box, and the list will filter in real-time to show entries containing the keywords. You can search text content, file names, etc.

## Manage Clipboard Entries

You can perform basic management operations on clipboard history:

- **Favorite/Pin:** For frequently used content, hover over an entry to see a **pin** icon. Click the icon to "pin" or "favorite" the entry, making it appear at the top or in the "Favorites" category for quick access.
- **Delete Entries:**
  - Select unwanted entries and press the `Delete` key.
  - Alternatively, right-click on an entry and choose the "Delete" option.
- **Clear History (Optional):** The settings or right-click menu may provide an option to clear all history (use with caution).

## Basic Sync (Requires Login)

If you register and log in to a NewbeePaste account:

- Your clipboard history (text, image links, and optionally files) will automatically sync across all devices logged into the same account.
- Content copied on one device will soon appear in the clipboard history on another device for use.

::: warning Important Notes

- On first use, the app may request "Accessibility" permissions (for features like double-click paste) or "Full Disk Access" permissions (if handling files from any location). Grant these permissions as needed to ensure functionality.
- Paste operations insert content into the current **active window** at the cursor position. Ensure your cursor is in the correct location before pasting.
